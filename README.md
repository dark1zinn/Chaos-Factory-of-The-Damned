# chaos-factory-of-the-damned

A game made with Bun, Vite and JavaScript.

### to-do:

- player render (draw)
- player movement
- implement Events
- implements gravity and correctly apply it

### tested

- player not rendering properly:
    one of the causes was the gravity module, which caused the player sprite to vanish, other possibilitie may be the file importing with JavaScript.
